Citibike Bike Sharing Program

According to the New York Department of Transportation, in 2018 about 900,000 New Yorkers regularly tode a bike, and there were 510,000 trips made by bicycle each day. 
This uptick in a more active mode of travel versus riding the bus or driving a car has made way for not only an increase in bike shops and riding lcubs, but also an increast in initiatives and organizations created to ensure the biking population is protected during ther commute, and they have consistent hassle-free access to a bicycle when one is needed.
One of the organizations making this access possible is Citi Bike; the nation's largest bike share program standing firm with 20,000 bicycles and 1,300 stations across Manhattan, Jersey City, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx.
Due to the global pandemic that began changing normal routines everywhere around the end of 2019, it was decided that this analysis would use Citi Bike Systems' data from March - June of 2019, to take a look into what petterns and trends are forming, and how effective the program has been in supporting the desires of the New York area population to get out there and ride.
